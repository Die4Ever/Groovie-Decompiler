# Groovie-Decompiler
Tool to 'decompile' Groovie scripts (T7G, 11H, Clandestiny) into a more readable assembler-like format

## Todo
* Change some of the references (labels, possibly VDX refs) from decimal offsets to hex
* Auto-add comments
* Possibly document various flags in output (eg, which cursor is shown on hotspots, etc)
